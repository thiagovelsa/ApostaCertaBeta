# Frontend Design Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate this skill when the user:
- Asks to build web components, pages, or applications
- Requests landing pages, dashboards, or React components
- Wants HTML/CSS layouts or to beautify web UI
- Provides frontend requirements with design direction
- Seeks production-grade interfaces with exceptional visual quality

## Design Thinking Process

Before coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:

### 1. Understand Purpose
- What problem does this interface solve?
- Who uses it?
- What's the user journey?

### 2. Pick an Extreme Aesthetic Direction
Choose one and commit to it:
- **Brutally Minimal**: Whitespace, single color, maximum clarity
- **Maximalist Chaos**: Layered complexity, visual abundance, organized chaos
- **Retro-Futuristic**: 80s/90s tech aesthetics, neon, geometric
- **Organic/Natural**: Flowing forms, natural materials, earthy tones
- **Luxury/Refined**: Elegant, sophisticated, high-end materials
- **Playful/Toy-like**: Friendly, rounded, colorful, approachable
- **Editorial/Magazine**: Typography-focused, hierarchical, narrative-driven
- **Brutalist/Raw**: Exposed structure, raw materials, no-frills
- **Art Deco/Geometric**: Symmetrical patterns, bold lines, geometric forms
- **Soft/Pastel**: Gentle colors, smooth transitions, calming
- **Industrial/Utilitarian**: Function-first, mechanical, stripped-down

### 3. Technical Constraints
- Framework requirement (HTML/CSS, React, Vue, etc.)
- Performance considerations
- Accessibility needs
- Browser support

### 4. Define Differentiation
What makes this UNFORGETTABLE?
- What's the one thing someone will remember?
- What's the unexpected creative choice?

## Implementation Requirements

### Typography
- **Choose boldly**: Distinctive, beautiful fonts (NOT Arial, Inter, Roboto, system fonts)
- **Display Font**: Unique, characterful, memorable
- **Body Font**: Refined, readable, complementary to display
- **Font Pairing**: Unexpected but harmonious combinations

Examples of distinctive choices: Playfair Display, Bebas Neue, IBM Plex, Abril Fatface, Montserrat, Space Mono, Courier Prime (for tech), Quicksand (for playful), Crimson Text (for editorial)

### Color & Theme
- **Commit to aesthetic**: Cohesive color system matching the direction
- **Use CSS variables**: `--primary`, `--accent`, `--text`, `--bg`
- **Dominant + Accent**: Strong primary colors with sharp accents outperform timid palettes
- **Avoid**: Generic purple gradients on white, overused combinations

### Motion & Animation
- **CSS-first for HTML**: Prioritize CSS animations and transitions
- **Motion library for React**: Use libraries like Framer Motion when beneficial
- **High-impact moments**: Page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay)
- **Micro-interactions**: Hover states, scroll-triggers, transitions that surprise
- **Don't overdo**: 2-3 well-orchestrated moments beat scattered effects

### Spatial Composition
- **Unexpected layouts**: Break grid patterns intentionally
- **Asymmetry**: Deliberate imbalance creates visual interest
- **Overlap & Layering**: Elements interact with each other
- **Diagonal Flow**: Break from rigid vertical/horizontal alignment
- **Negative Space**: Generous whitespace OR controlled density (not middle ground)

### Visual Details & Atmosphere
- **Backgrounds**: Gradients, patterns, textures (not solid colors)
- **Depth**: Shadows, layering, perspective
- **Decorative Effects**: Geometric patterns, noise textures, grain overlays
- **Custom Elements**: Custom cursors, decorative borders, SVG details
- **Context-specific**: Effects match the overall aesthetic, not generic

## What to AVOID

**NEVER use generic AI aesthetics:**
- Generic font families: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts
- Clichéd color schemes: Purple gradients, overused combinations
- Predictable layouts: Standard cards, centered content, cookie-cutter patterns
- Overused components: Modal windows, dropdown menus without personality
- Lack of context: Design that could work for any project

**CRITICAL**: Every design should be unique and specific to its context.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Analyze requirements**: Read the user's request carefully for constraints and preferences
2. **Choose direction**: Commit to ONE clear aesthetic vision
3. **Define typography**: Select distinctive display + body font pair
4. **Set color system**: Define CSS variables for cohesive color scheme
5. **Plan layout**: Sketch or describe the unexpected spatial composition
6. **Code structure**: Build semantic HTML/component structure
7. **Style systematically**: Apply colors, typography, spacing with intention
8. **Add motion**: Implement animations and micro-interactions
9. **Visual refinement**: Add textures, shadows, decorative details
10. **Test and iterate**: Visual testing in browser, refine until memorable

## Code Quality Standards

- **Production-grade**: Functional, tested, production-ready code
- **Semantic**: Clean HTML structure, accessible markup
- **Organized**: Well-commented, maintainable code structure
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first approach when applicable
- **Performance**: Optimize images, animations, load times
- **Browser compatible**: Test across target browsers

## Complexity Matching

- **Maximalist designs** need elaborate code: extensive animations, effects, layered visuals
- **Minimal designs** still need detail: precision spacing, typography refinement, subtle interactions
- **Match ambition to implementation**: The code complexity should serve the design vision

## Visual Testing

Always test the implementation:
- Screenshot the result to verify design execution
- Check animations and transitions in browser
- Verify responsive behavior on different screen sizes
- Ensure accessibility (color contrast, keyboard navigation)
- Validate browser compatibility if needed

## Examples of Distinctive Choices

Instead of:
- Generic "modern" grey + blue → **Bold jewel tones or monochromatic + neon accent**
- Centered layout → **Asymmetrical, diagonal, or overlapping grid**
- Fade animations → **Staggered bounces, scale reveals, or morphing shapes**
- Helvetica/Arial → **Playfair Display + Space Mono, or Bebas + Crimson Text**
- Flat design → **Layered depth, dramatic shadows, geometric patterns**

## Remember

Great frontend design is:
- ✓ Intentional in every choice
- ✓ Specific to its context
- ✓ Bold and memorable
- ✓ Functionally excellent
- ✓ Visually distinctive
- ✓ Technically sound

Never settle for generic. Every project is an opportunity to create something unforgettable.
